# JavaLabs
**Java Assignments for CIS 1068**

These are projects from my Java 1 course at Temple University. These projects were made in Spring 2019.
Each project taught me something new. From OOP to JUnit testing, this course was definitely a huge help
in furthing my understanding of programming and prepared me well for Java 2 - Data Structures.

Hope you enjoy! :)
